# SwiftCodeSample
This project was created in order to show my programming skills.

Task: Need to write an application that will contain one “Login option” screen.
When the application starts, a logo is displayed (you can select any image) and
Tennant selection button (Organization).
1) The list of fields must be obtained from the server:
https://itunes.applikator.dk/ios_task/tenants.json
2) Each Tennant (Organization) has a name and a list of supported options.
for entry:
Password - It is necessary to display the fields: name, password, login button.
Guest is just a login button.

Note: FOR CODE DEMONSTRATION ONLY.
